## 💼 Project Summary

With over 426,000 vehicle listings analyzed, this project aims to uncover what drives pricing in the used car market. By building predictive models and extracting feature importance, it offers insights into how dealerships can better manage inventory, optimize pricing strategies, and focus marketing efforts.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Linear, Lasso, Ridge Regression)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Data cleaning, encoding, scaling, and modeling
- CRISP-DM project framework

## 🔍 Key Contributions

- Engineered new features (e.g. vehicle age) to improve prediction accuracy
- Modeled linear relationships and applied Lasso regularization for feature selection
- Created an ensemble model to boost performance
- Visualized predictions and interpreted model coefficients for stakeholder insights
- Delivered strategic recommendations based on data outcomes

## 📈 Business Impact

- Identified key pricing drivers like age, mileage, condition, and brand
- Provided dealerships with a predictive tool to evaluate potential car values
- Helped inform data-backed pricing and inventory decisions

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Extend modeling with XGBoost or Random Forests for non-linear effects
- Add geographic insights (e.g. regional pricing trends)
- Build a user-facing app using Streamlit or Gradio
